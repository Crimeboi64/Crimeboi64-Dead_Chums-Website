        <p>Uro Titan of Nature’s Wrath is quite a powerful creature, but what kind of deck would you make to play the coolest deck around the table. </p>
    <p>Uro’s biggest drawback is having to escape him. We want ramp, draw or discard spells and abilities, and last little creature to deal damage throughout the whole game. </p>
    <p>Making a 60 card deck we start with 3 Uro’s, 2 Primeval Titans, and 2 Frost Titans. The goal is to pull two or three big boys and deal lots of damage before the Uro awakens. With 20 total lands, 8 forest and 8 islands, with a combination of Thornwood falls or Healing Pool for the last 4 lands to account for lands that may be milled. </p>
    <div class="blue"><p>Looking out the blue cards we want 4 Careful Studies, and 1 Rhystic Study. Faithless looting is perfect, but that’s led, well there is a blue version, Careful Study, so this is a perfect addition to the deck with Rhystic Study helping with card draw. A perfect card to discard is a Deep Analysis, for 2 blue one can draw two, give me 3; fight me for a reason not to include it. Next it seems like a different take, but we don’t want our opponents to get ahead when you’re behind, so 4 Rites of Refusal, two things it discards and it costs two, and second it counters an opponent’s spell. Next 2 Obsessive Searches, for one blue you draw a card, but for one blue you can cast it for its madness, one can make the most use of a doomed card. Last 2 Thought Vessels. </p></div>
    <div class="green"><p>The green cards in this deck are to discard cards and hold defense. Four Greenseekers and another four Wild Mongrals. They both have discard abilities but it’s the bonus that makes them so worthy, as the Greenseeker searches the library for lands guaranteeing lands drops for every turn. Wild Mongral makes a great attacker and can evade color removal, or color protection. Basking Rootwalla has a madness cost of zero for a 1/1 with an activated ability to pump it to a 3/3. While the ability isn’t to special, madness is important here, discarding this creature leads to no loss as you get him back for doing nothing; 3 of him. Of course, we must have 4 Rampant Growths or something of that nature, with another 2 Lanowar Elves or Elvish Mystics to get more ramp, and to finish the deck. </p></div>
    <p>That is a 60-card deck that I believe will lead to a good Uro win. Thanks for Reading. </p></div>
